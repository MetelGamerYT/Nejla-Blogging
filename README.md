# Nejla - Blogging

Nejla is a blogging site that has an admin page (for creating posts), a home page and a posts page with all posts sorted from newest to oldest. If not everyone should post blogs, the admin area must of course be "secured"

## Installation

  1. Create a database called "metel_blogging" and import the corresponding .sql file
  1. Configure the mysql.php file with your values
  1. And configure the navbar in the index.php(from the main folder)
